      <h1>Mardi Himal is a mountain peak located in the Annapurna region of Nepal, which is a popular trekking destination. With an elevation of 5,587 meters (18,330 feet), Mardi Himal is considered one of the smaller peaks in the Annapurna range, but it is known for its stunning views of the surrounding mountains, including Annapurna, Machapuchare (also known as Fishtail), and Hiunchuli.
          The Mardi Himal trek is a relatively less crowded and off-the-beaten-path trek compared to other popular treks in the Annapurna region, such as the Annapurna Base Camp (ABC) or the Annapurna Circuit. The trek typically starts from Pokhara, a popular tourist destination in Nepal, and takes around 7-10 days to complete, depending on the itinerary and trekking pace.
          The Mardi Himal trek offers a diverse landscape, including lush forests, terraced fields, high alpine meadows, and snow-capped peaks. Trekkers can experience the local culture and lifestyle of ethnic communities, such as Gurung and Magar, who inhabit the region. The trek usually involves moderate difficulty with some steep and challenging sections, making it suitable for experienced trekkers or those with previous trekking experience.
          Overall, the Mardi Himal trek is known for its pristine beauty, panoramic mountain vistas, and a sense of wilderness, making it a popular choice for nature lovers and adventure seekers looking for a less crowded and off-the-beaten-path trekking experience in Nepal.</h1>
